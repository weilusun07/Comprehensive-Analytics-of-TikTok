# EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) of TikTok Datasets

## Project Overview
This project explores two TikTok datasets, focusing on videos related to eating disorder and self-harm, to uncover insights through statistical analysis, natural language processing (NLP), and network science. The datasets include detailed metadata on videos and comments, offering a comprehensive view of user engagement and content trends.

## Datasets
- **Urls_Scrape**: Contains video metadata such as user information, video description, hashtags, music information, technical parameters, and engagement statistics (likes, shares, comments, and plays).
- **Comments**: Stores information on comments made on videos, including user IDs, comment text, number of likes, and usernames.

## Objectives
- To perform a detailed exploratory data analysis to identify key trends, user behavior, and content engagement.
- To apply statistical tests, NLP for sentiment analysis, and network science techniques to analyze the data.

## Findings
The analysis revealed trends in video engagement, popular hashtags, user verification status, and the impact of video duration on popularity. I also conducted sentiment analysis on comments to identify networks of users with similar interests.

## Technologies Used
- Python for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and NLTK, VADER for sentiment analysis.
